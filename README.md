## MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN:

There are many sub-folders in this repository. These are assignments that I practiced and made during the MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. This course is divided into three parts(See the below), and this particular repository is made up of things created during the first part of them.

* In part one of the course, you will develop foundational skills in web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  You’ll also create your own personal portfolio in Github, which you will add to as you progress through the course.  

* In part two, you will dive deep into front end development. You will write clean, concise code with JavaScript ES6 and use these skills to work with web components in React.  You will learn how to build React applications and how to test and deploy them.  

* In part three, you’ll work on back end development.  You will work with MongoDB, ExpressJS, and NodeJS to become confident in the MERN stack. You will learn the essentials for working in the cloud, automated testing, and deployment for a solid foundation in DevOps.
